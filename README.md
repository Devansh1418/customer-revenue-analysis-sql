# Customer & Revenue Analysis using Advanced SQL

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and revenue patterns using **Advanced SQL** on the **Global Superstore dataset**.  
The objective of the project is to extract meaningful business insights such as revenue trends, top-performing customers, and customer segmentation, which are essential for data-driven decision-making in real-world business scenarios.

This project was developed as part of **hands-on SQL practice suitable for internship-level data analysis work**.

##  Dataset Information
- **Dataset Name:** Global Superstore  
- **Domain:** Retail Sales  
- **Format:** CSV  
- **Number of Records:** ~48,000  
- **Stored At:** `data/superstore.csv`

The dataset contains order details, customer information, regional data, and sales values.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
- SQL (Advanced queries)
- DB Browser for SQLite
- GitHub (Version Control & Project Hosting)
  

##  SQL Concepts Demonstrated
- Aggregate functions (`SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`)
- `GROUP BY` and `ORDER BY`
- `CASE WHEN` for customer segmentation
- Date-based analysis
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)


##  Analysis Performed
The following analyses were carried out using SQL:

1. **Monthly Revenue Trend**  
   Analyzes how revenue changes over time on a monthly basis.

2. **Top Customers by Revenue**  
   Identifies the top 10 customers contributing the highest revenue.

3. **Customer Segmentation**  
   Classifies customers into High, Medium, and Low value segments based on total spending.

4. **Revenue by Region**  
   Evaluates revenue contribution from different geographical regions.

5. **Customer Revenue Summary (CTE)**  
   Uses a Common Table Expression to calculate average, maximum, and minimum revenue per customer.
